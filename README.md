# Pdf-Chatbot

Study Buddy is an AI-powered chatbot featuring a MERN-based login system and a Flask backend that utilizes the locally installed Ollama Llava model. Full deployment is not possible due to limitations in free cloud hosting services, which impose restrictions on storage, RAM, and compute power required for AI models. Additionally, most hosting services do not support running local AI models. As a result, we have provided a demonstration video on Google Drive showcasing the chatbot's functionality. The deployment link currently displays only the static pages.

Thank you
