 is amplified to reproduce the original message signal. The receiver's output is compared with a reference signal (local oscillator) to synchronize and extract the information.

The overall performance of an analog communication system depends on several factors such as the quality of the transmitted signal, channel characteristics, noise level, and the design of the transmitter and receiver sections. Analog communication systems have been largely replaced by digital communication systems in recent years due to their lower capacity, lower error rates, and higher susceptibility to noise and interference.
